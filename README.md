# Agriculture_Forecasting-with-IOT

### Description
Problem Statement:

Nowadays Farmers are dependent on rain and Boring well to irrigate their lands. 
They need to turn ON/OFF water pump manually but before they have to check whether the soil needs watering or not.
This process is time consuming because they have to check the soil manually in regular intervals otherwise the corps can get damage because of failure of water supply.

Solution:

With the aid of IOT, we can automate the entire process by keeping an eye on environmental variables like soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.
Sensors may be utilised to gather this information, and by doing so, we can use it to turn the motor ON or OFF without the farmer's help.
